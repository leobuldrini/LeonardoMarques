# About me
Currently majoring Computer Science at PUC-Minas, I'm someone focused on always being able to *outcome the problems*, **to think outside the box**. Solving problems and *hard challenges* have acquired my attention since I was little and, not always having a easy way to overcome them, **I have become autodidact** when it comes to *developing*. Programming **since before high-school**, I acquired experience on many different areas of computer science. My main objective right now is to study and develop AI that will ***help people that have trouble with computers and technology, and make life as easier as possible for those who doesn't got the chance to be who they desired to be***.
